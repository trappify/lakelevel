# Usage

Once configured, the integration exposes a sensor named `<Lake> water level`.

Attributes:
- `river`: River/älv the lake belongs to.
- `timestamp`: Measurement timestamp reported by vattenreglering.se.

Use the sensor in automations or dashboards like any other Home Assistant sensor. For a manual refresh outside the scheduled time, use the entity’s **Update** action in the UI; the integration respects the retry settings.
